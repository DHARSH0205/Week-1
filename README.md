# 🧠 Waste Classification using CNN

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The growing problem of improper waste management stems from inadequate collection, segregation, and recycling systems. This leads to environmental pollution, health hazards, and inefficient resource utilization. Manual waste segregation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often inaccurate.

To address this, the project aims to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based image classification system capable of automatically categorizing solid waste into four major types — **Plastic, Paper, Metal, and Organic**.

This **AI-powered solution** supports sustainable waste management practices by enabling faster and more accurate segregation for recycling and disposal.
